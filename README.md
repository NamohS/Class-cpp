#### 1][3d_volume](usingclass_3D_Cube_Volume_Calculator.cpp)
This program calculates the volume of a 3D cube. The user is prompted to enter the height, length, and width of the cube, and the program then calculates and displays the volume.

The program uses a class called `cube` to represent the cube. The `cube` class has three private data members: `height`, `length`, and `width`. The class also has a public method called `volume()` that calculates and returns the volume of the cube.

The main function of the program creates an instance of the `cube` class and then calls the `input()` method to get the height, length, and width of the cube from the user. The program then calls the `volume()` method to calculate the volume of the cube and displays the result.

output:

     Enter the height of the cube: 5
     Enter the length of the cube: 10
     Enter the width of the cube: 15

     The volume of the cube is 750
